# Project Details
In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging, and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative. That dataset that you are working with is real, and it is pretty big. When you are an analyst for a company, there often isn’t guidance on how to correctly answer a particular question. And there might not really be one right answer. Leverage your skills. Make sure you look through the directions carefully.

## Project Description
Your goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from:
* Flight Delays and Cancellations
* US Census Demographic Data
* Youtube Data from the US

#### Reminders
Your visualization work should use Tableau: other visualization tools may not be evaluated by reviewers. Host your dashboards/stories on Tableau Public, you'll be submitting them to reviewers and this makes them easily accessible.

Remember that your visualization should be explanatory in nature and communicate specific results that you want to show.

### Submission

A PDF report that includes the following sections:
* Links to your dashboards or story
* You must submit url links for each of your visuals from Tableau Public. If you need a reminder on how to save to Tableau Public, please see the next concept.
* Summary: brief description of the visualization and the main story or findings conveyed
* Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback
* Resources: list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).
