# Project Detials
## Chinook Database
### Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

The diagram shows a schema of 11 relations: Artist, Album, Track, Media Type, Playlist, Playlist Track, Genre, Employee, Customer, Invoice and InvoiceLine.
The schema for the Chinook Database.

### Project Overview
All of the instructions are discussed in detail as you work through this lesson on your way to completing this project.

### Instructions
#### Step 1: Get the Chinook database up and running.
You can run the DB Browser database on your own machine (See the Set Up the DB Browser Database page) or you can use the provided workspace (see the Chinook Postgres SQL Workspace page).

#### Step 2: Complete the SQL Question Sets
This series of questions will confirm that you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer and are intended to help you self-assess.

#### Step 3: Create the Presentation
There isn't a 'right answer' for this portion of the project. The project is designed to allow you to be creative in the questions you ask and then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully.

You will use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question and present that information in a slide deck using PowerPoint, Google Slides or your favorite presentation software.

Your presentation should include:
* Four slides
* One visualization per slide
* A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
* The SQL query is used to create the data used in the visualization.

##### Queries
Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations.

* All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit join(s). The query's JOIN or
* JOINs should be necessary to answer the question. If a question does not require a
* JOIN, please change the question to be one that does.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregation(s). This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.
* The project includes at least four unique SQL queries.
